# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project involved analyzing a telecom customer dataset to understand and predict customer churn using *Jupyter Notebook*. The dataset contained records of customers who either stayed or left the company based on different variables in the data. The analysis included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), skewness checking, and building a predictive model to determine churn likelihood.
The assignment was guided by a list of structured tasks provided by the instructor.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean the customer dataset
- Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key features using tables and charts
- Check for skewness in the data and apply corrections if needed
- Build a predictive machine learning model to classify churn vs. non-churn
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
  - pandas
  - matplotlib / seaborn
  - scikit-learn
- NumPy

##  Key Steps in the Notebook
1. *Data Import*: Load CSV into Jupyter using pandas
2. *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing/null values, remove duplicates
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Generate tables and plots for key features
4. *Skewness Analysis*: Measure and correct skewness in features
5. *Model Building*: Used classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Trees)
6. *Prediction*: Identified customers likely to churn
7. *Evaluation*: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

##  What I Learned
- How to use *Jupyter Notebook* for data science workflows
- Improved skills in *data preprocessing and cleaning*
- How to check and handle *skewed data*
- How to train and evaluate a *machine learning classification model*
- Gained confidence in *structuring and presenting notebooks* clearly
